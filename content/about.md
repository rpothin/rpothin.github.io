# About Me

Hi 👋🏼 I’m Raphael Pothin.
Welcome to my personal website and blog!

## In a nutshell

- I work around **Microsoft Power Platform** and **Fabric (Power BI)**, with a focus on **governance** and **developer experience**.
- I’m a **Microsoft MVP (Business Applications)** and I enjoy contributing through talks, writing, and open-source.
- Lately, I’ve been pivoting toward **AI** and how it’s reshaping software engineering (especially as **AI agents** become part of our daily workflows).
- Want to chat? Reach out about **AI engineering**, **software delivery/ALM**, **platform governance**, or **Power Platform / Dynamics 365**.

## My journey across the world

1. Born in **Réunion**, a beautiful French island in the Indian Ocean
2. Moved to **Lyon, France** to study engineering and start my career
3. Moved to **Montreal, Canada** to start my family and continue my journey in the tech industry

## My professional background

I started my career by discovering CRM solutions during internships while I was a student.

### Foundations — CRM consulting (France)

Those experiences led me to my first role as a **CRM consultant** in a services company near Lyon, where I deepened my knowledge of the domain and of **Microsoft Dynamics CRM** (on-premises, 2011 version at the time).

### Growth — Dynamics 365 + Power Platform in the real world (Montreal)

After a few years, I wanted to explore new horizons and moved to Montreal. I joined a services company, working on internal needs to enhance our **Dynamics 365-based** business applications system. Along the way, I went through:

- an on-premises to cloud migration of our Dynamics 365 CRM system
- the deployment of the HR and Project Operations modules of Dynamics 365
- exploration of newly released Power Platform services and their integration with Dynamics 365

### Scale — delivery, ALM, and governance

This consolidation of skills around the Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 ecosystem led me to my first role outside of the services industry, in finance. I joined a team at the beginning of an ambitious project to deploy **Dynamics 365 Sales** to **20,000+ users**.

During that experience, I gradually took a step back from day-to-day feature delivery in Dynamics 365 to invest more time in:

- implementing a reliable and effective **ALM process in Azure DevOps**
- **infrastructure as code** for Azure resources integrated with our Dynamics 365 system
- technical guidance for implementation teams

---

In parallel, I started my Dynamics 365 / Power Platform community journey by speaking at events, writing blog posts, and creating open-source projects. In 2020, I was recognized as a **Microsoft MVP** in the **Business Applications** category for my contributions. Since then, my contributions gradually shifted and, until recently, I focused on **Power Platform governance, security, and developer experience**.

---

From a job perspective, I later joined an organization with a more global scope, where I’m part of the team responsible for the governance and management of the **Power Platform** and **Fabric (Power BI)** platforms in the broader Microsoft ecosystem.

## What next?

Alongside my Power Platform work and community contributions, I’ve been slowly but surely pivoting toward **AI** and how it will redefine my work as a software engineer.

After months of questioning and reflection, I’m now intentionally investing in this direction: helping shape what software engineering looks like in an AI-first world, including improving the experience of **AI agents** that are becoming part of our daily lives—maximizing their usefulness while minimizing their risks.

I won’t forget where I’m coming from—Power Platform and the broader Microsoft ecosystem—but I also can’t ignore the shift AI is bringing. I want to be **equipped** to be part of it, and to help others be part of it too.
