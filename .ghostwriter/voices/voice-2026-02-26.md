## 1. Voice Profile

| Dimension              | Observation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tone**               | Warm, approachable, and genuinely enthusiastic without being over-the-top. You come across as a knowledgeable colleague sharing what you've learned — never lecturing. There's a consistent undercurrent of humility ("not a huge number, but I'm genuinely proud of them") and gratitude ("I'm grateful for the community"). |
| **Pacing**             | Measured and deliberate. You set context before diving into details. Introductions are conversational, technical sections are methodical and step-by-step. You rarely rush — you give the reader time to absorb before moving on.                                                                                             |
| **Formality**          | Semi-formal. Professional enough for a technical audience but peppered with casual asides, first-person reflection, and the occasional emoji (😉) or parenthetical humor. You address the reader directly ("you," "here I am") and use contractions freely.                                                                   |
| **Sentence length**    | Medium — typically 15–30 words. You mix shorter punchy observations ("It is not about the tools!") with longer, clause-heavy sentences that unpack nuance. You lean toward compound sentences joined by commas and dashes rather than dense academic constructions.                                                           |
| **Point of view**      | Predominantly first-person singular ("For me," "I think," "I started"). You frequently pivot to second-person ("you") to pull the reader into the scenario. Occasional first-person plural ("we") when speaking about shared community practices.                                                                             |
| **Emotional register** | Genuine curiosity and excitement about discovery. You share things you find "interesting and exciting" and explicitly flag when something is a personal opinion vs. established fact.                                                                                                                                         |

## 2. Reusable Style Rules

### Do

- **Lead with context and motivation** — explain _why_ something matters before explaining _how_ it works.
- **Use bold text liberally** for key terms, product names, and conceptual anchors within paragraphs and lists.
- **Qualify opinions honestly** — preface positions with "For me," "From my point of view," or "I think."
- **Acknowledge others generously** — credit people by name, thank product teams, link to others' work.
- **Use bulleted and numbered lists** to break down options, steps, or principles.
- **Include callouts/admonitions** (NOTE, TIP, WARNING) for important caveats or updates.
- **Write in short, titled sections** — H2 headings phrased as statements or questions that guide the reader.
- **Provide real-world analogies and relatable framing** ("it is like this platform has been built to…").
- **Use transitions that feel conversational** — "So here I am," "Let's not forget," "Here we are talking about."
- **Update articles over time** and mark updates with dates inline.

### Don't

- Don't use overly academic or stiff language — no "heretofore," "thus" (rare exception), or passive-heavy constructions.
- Don't claim absolute authority — avoid "you must" or "the only way." Prefer "I try to promote" or "could definitely be an interesting approach."
- Don't skip the human layer — never write a purely mechanical tutorial without sharing _why_ you explored it or _what you felt_ discovering it.
- Don't use heavy jargon without at least a brief inline explanation or link.
- Don't write walls of text — if a paragraph exceeds ~5 sentences, break it up or convert to a list.
- Don't be negative about tools or platforms — frame limitations as opportunities or things "in progress." ("I do not say the different tools… are perfect… but…")

## 3. Lexicon

### Favorite Phrases & Transitions

| Pattern                | Examples                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Personal framing**   | "For me," "From my point of view," "I think it is really important to…"                |
| **Enthusiasm**         | "really interesting," "interesting and exciting," "amazing," "a little bit hidden gem" |
| **Inclusive pull**     | "Let's not forget," "As you can guess," "I hope you will find that interesting"        |
| **Narrative momentum** | "So here I am," "At some point it clicked," "Here we are talking about"                |
| **Hedging / humility** | "perhaps," "probably," "we all know it is not always the case, but…"                   |
| **Gratitude**          | "A big thank you to…," "Thanks to the Product team," "I'm grateful for…"               |
| **Temporal grounding** | "Yesterday, if you were looking to…," "Few weeks back," "Today, more than ever"        |

### Words & Patterns to Avoid (based on absence in your writing)

- Sarcasm or snark
- "Simply," "just," "obviously" (when dismissing complexity — you use "obviously" only when genuinely referencing common knowledge)
- Clickbait superlatives ("mind-blowing," "game-changer," "ultimate guide")
- Passive voice as default

---

## 4. Structure Patterns

### Introductions

- **1–3 short paragraphs** that set the scene personally: what prompted the article, who shared something interesting, or what problem you encountered.
- Often include a direct address or welcome ("Welcome — and thanks for being here").
- Frequently reference a catalyst — a tweet, a conversation, a feature announcement.

### Body

- **H2 sections as the primary organizing unit**, often phrased as a statement ("It is not only about the tools!") or a question ("Does a branch per environment… is a relevant strategy?").
- Heavy use of **bold within bullet lists** for scanability.
- Code blocks, images with descriptive alt-text, and embedded links to official documentation.
- Callout blocks (NOTE, TIP, WARNING) for caveats, updates, and prerequisites.

### Endings

- Tend to be **brief and understated** — no dramatic conclusion or CTA. Often a short note, a thanks, or a forward-looking sentence.
- Sometimes end with a practical "Note" section addressing known issues or edge cases.
- Rarely use a formal "Conclusion" heading — prefer to let the last section naturally wind down.

### Heading Style

- Title case or sentence case (inconsistent — leans sentence case in newer work).
- Descriptive, often conversational. Questions are common.

## 5. Sample Imitation Paragraph

> **⚠️ This is a generated sample imitating Raphaël's style — not his actual writing.**
>
> Few days ago, I stumbled upon a new feature in GitHub Copilot that really caught my attention. At first glance, it seemed like a small quality-of-life improvement — but the more I dug into it, the more I realized it could change the way I approach code reviews in my day-to-day work. For me, what makes it genuinely interesting is not the feature itself, but what it signals about where AI-assisted engineering is heading. I hope you will find the details below as exciting as I did, and as always, I would love to hear your perspective on it.
