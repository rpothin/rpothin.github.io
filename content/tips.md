# Navigation Tips

This site is designed to look and feel like **VS Code** — because, as software engineers, we spend most of our time in editors and terminals.

Here's how to find your way around.

## Explorer sidebar

Click the **folder icon** in the activity bar (the narrow strip on the far left) to toggle the Explorer sidebar. It shows two collapsible sections:

- **POSTS** — original blog posts, newest first
- **ARCHIVE** — past Medium articles, organized by topic and series

Click any title to open it as a tab, just like opening a file in your editor.

## Search

Click the **magnifying glass icon** in the activity bar to open the Search panel. Type a keyword and results will appear instantly — the index covers all posts and archive content.

## Tabs

Every page you visit opens in a tab in the tab bar. You can:

- **Click a tab** to switch between open pages
- **Close a tab** with the × button or by middle-clicking it
- **Right-click a tab** for more options (Close Others, Close All)
- **Navigate between tabs** using arrow keys when a tab is focused

## Dark / Light theme

Click the **sun/moon icon** at the bottom of the activity bar to switch between dark and light themes. Your preference is saved in your browser.

## RSS feed

Want to know when new posts are published? Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml) in your favorite reader.

## Keyboard navigation

The site supports full keyboard navigation:

- **Tab** moves focus through interactive elements
- **Skip to content** link appears on first Tab press to jump past the sidebar
- **Arrow keys** navigate tabs in the tab bar
- **Escape** closes context menus
