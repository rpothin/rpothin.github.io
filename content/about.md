# About Me

Hi 👋🏼 I’m Raphael Pothin.
Welcome to my personal website and blog!

## My journey accross the world

1. Born in Reunion, a beautiful French island in the Indian Ocean
2. Moved to Lyon, France for my studies in an engineering school and start my career
3. Moved to Montreal, Canada to start my family and continue my professional journey in the tech industry

## My professional background

Surprisingly enough, I have started my career discovering CRM solutions during my internships when I was a student.

These experiences enabled me to get my first job as a CRM consultant in a service company in the Lyon area in France, where I had the chance to deepen my knowledge of this domain and of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM solution - in its on-premises 2011 version at the time.

After a few years, I wanted to explore new horizons and took the opportunity to move to Montreal, Canada, where I started working at a service company but for internal needs enhancing our Dynamics 365 based business applications system. There I went through:

- a on-premises to cloud migration of our Dynamics 365 CRM system
- the deployment of the HR and Project Operations modules of Dynamics 365
- exploration of the newly released Power Platform services and their integration with Dynamics 365

This consolidation of my skills around the Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 ecosystem led me to my first role outside of the service industry to the finance industry, where I joined a team at the beginning of an ambitious project to deploy Dynamics 365 Sales to 20,000+ users. During this experience, I slowly took some steps back to stop working directly on Dynamics 365 side of things and invest more time on the implementation of a reliable and effective ALM process in Azure Devops, the infrastructure as code for our Azure resources integrated with our Dynamics 365 system, and technical guidance of the implemntation teams.

In parallel of this experience, I also started my Dynamics 365 / Power Platform community journey by speaking at events, writing blog posts, and creating open source projects. And in 2020, I have been recognized as a Microsoft MVP in the Business Applications category for my contributions to the community. Since then, my community contributions slowly shifted and until recently I was focusing on Power Platform governance, security and developer experience.

From a job perspective, I then left my first employer in the finance industry for another one with a more global scope and where I am part of the team responsible for the governance and management of the Power Platform and Fabric (aka Power BI) platforms in the broader Microsoft ecosystem.

## What next?

AI is fundamentally transforming the way we work and redefining how software engineers ...
