# About Me

Hi, I'm Raphael Pothin 👋🏼

I am a **Microsoft MVP** focused on **Power Platform governance, security, and developer experience**, slowly but surely transitioning into **AI native software engineering** and **AI Coding Agent Experience**.

This site is where I document my explorations and learnings — first for myself, then to contribute back to the community and **reduce the cost of learning** for others.

## Who this site is for

I write primarily for **Power Platform technical professionals** — admins, architects, and developers navigating governance, security, and delivery at scale.

I'm also expanding to reach **software engineers** and **engineering leaders** looking to get the best out of AI in software engineering — because many of the challenges we went through in the Power Platform space seem close to the ones emerging in the AI space: adoption, accessibility, engineering rigor, and governance.

## What I focus on

I explore **emerging topics that are not yet well documented, understood, or widely adopted** — but that could bring real value to enterprises.

Concretely, that means:

- **Power Platform governance and security**: guardrails and patterns that enable rather than block, from ALM to threat detection
- **Platform engineering for Power Platform**: applying infrastructure-as-code and developer experience principles to low-code platforms
- **AI native software engineering**: how AI agents change the way we build software, and how to adopt them with engineering rigor

## What makes this content different

I've always felt at the edge of what my peers were focusing on — and that's by design.

- I was exploring **ALM and DevOps for Power Platform** with only a few others long before Microsoft shipped the Pipelines feature
- I started working on **Power Platform security patterns** when solution providers like Zenity weren't yet mainstream
- More recently, I've been one of the first to explore how the **Power Platform Terraform provider** could bring platform engineering principles to the ecosystem

My approach is **experimentation-driven**: I balance innovation with practical learnings that can be applied in real-world enterprise contexts. I've always stayed open-minded about what's happening across the broader IT industry and tried to bring those practices back to the Power Platform space when they could add value.

Coming into the AI space, I bring that same lens — my experience making low-code/no-code more accessible and better adopted by software engineers and enterprises translates directly to the challenges of adopting AI with rigor and confidence.

## Why trust me?

A few proof points:

- [**Microsoft MVP (Business Applications)**](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/MVP/profile/f724ed87-7976-eb11-a812-000d3a8dfe0d) since March 2021
- A track record of community contributions: [talks at conferences](https://github.com/rpothin/Presentations) across multiple countries, blog posts (on the [Medium](https://medium.com/rapha%C3%ABl-pothin) platform before finally creating my own space here), and open-source projects

## My path

My career has followed an arc from delivery to platform thinking:

1. **CRM Consultant** — Learned enterprise software delivery fundamentals fast, lucky to be surrounded by peers and mentors who set a strong foundation
2. **Technical Product Owner** — Led a small team within a human-sized organization, shaping product direction hands-on
3. **Power Platform "SRE"** — Joined a larger institution as a technical lead but shifted to build tooling and patterns that helped delivery teams move faster and with more confidence
4. **Now** — Pursuing platform engineering for Power Platform and AI native software engineering, convinced both can transform how enterprises build software — if approached with the right mindset and practices

## Currently exploring

- **Terraform + Power Platform**: applying platform engineering principles to enhance governance, security, and developer experience
- **AI native software engineering**: unlocking the true potential of AI coding agents without compromising on engineering rigor and governance
