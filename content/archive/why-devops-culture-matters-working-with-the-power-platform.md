For me, the DevOps culture could be THE THING that makes the difference between organizations for which the Power Platform means chaos and the ones where it can empower every employee to achieve more, thus helping the company to be more successful.

## It is not (only) about the tools!

Many people in the DevOps community agree on the fact that that the tools are perhaps the less difficult part to implement in that story.

In the case of the Power Platform, I think it is really important to keep this point in mind, because it is like this platform has been built to easily and continuously deliver value to end users. Moreover, today we have many solutions we can combine to build strong pipelines to support your ALM process.

I do not say the different tools I talked about above are perfect (Microsoft and the community are continuously working to improve these tools), but in most cases if you are not able to deliver value to your end users with the Power Platform, this is probably not because of the platform itself.

## It is easy to create and update an application!

In fact, it is "so easy" (we all know it is not always the case, but I will use this shortcut to make my point) that I could do it directly in production. Why would I need to bother with development or test environments? Or even why would I need to think about the lifecycle of my applications?

Sometimes we can forget that some applications we are building using the Power Platform will support critical business processes of the organization. These applications are "so easy" to create and update that we even tend to less fear production incidents, because we think we will always be able to quickly deploy a correction.

As simple as it seems to be building these applications, we should always have quality (tests, static code analysis...) and security standards in mind when working on Power Platform applications. We should also constantly validate with end users the hypothesis we are making to address their pain points, by, for example, having short iterations or demonstration meetings to gather feedbacks.

It is not because it is easy to create value with the Power Platform that you should not take attention to the processes you follow. Having processes facilitate the onboarding of new members in your teams working with the platform, but also enable Power Platform developers moving from one team to another without the need to learn a new way to build great applications.

## Everyone can be involved!

At the beginning of the DevOps journey the goal was to improve the way development and operations teams were working together. Later, and even if the name did not change, all IT teams (QA, security, support...) has been considered in this cultural change.

We all know that in many companies the number of developers is not enough to deliver all the requested product features within a reasonable time. And it is why the no-code / low-code platforms, like the Power Platform, are so popular today. They allow non-IT teams to build the applications they need quicker that what the IT teams, who are really busy, can do.

Obviously, your organization could consciously, or worse unconsciously, ignore all the applications the non-IT teams are building. But just like I mentioned in the introduction, the day you will take a look at what is going on in the Power Platform you could (I want to insist on this point, because perhaps in your case everything will be great) find chaos.

In the other hand, if you accept and acknowledge this new group of contributors, called the citizen developers, you will be able to help them build applications by following adjusted versions of the processes and the tools your IT teams are already using.

Once again, the strength of the DevOps culture regarding this point consists in considering that everyone in the organization share the same goals and can deliver value following the same principles.

The DevOps journey is definitely not an easy one, and perhaps it is even more difficult around the Power Platform because more people can be involved. But I am convinced it is a really good culture to have in your organization if you want that make this platform the part of your IT system that will allow your organization to continue to move forward and to stay competitive in the future.
