# About

Welcome to my developer blog! This site is built with a VS Code-inspired theme to feel familiar to developers.

## About Me

I'm Raphael Pothin, a developer passionate about Power Platform, GitHub, and open source.

## About This Blog

This blog is built as a static site using:
- **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript** for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** with VS Code theme variables for styling
- **Shiki** for syntax highlighting (same engine as VS Code)
- **Lunr.js** for client-side full-text search
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

All content is written in Markdown and rendered at build time.
