# Privacy & Analytics

I want this site to be useful without being creepy.

## What’s enabled

This site uses **Cloudflare Web Analytics** to understand aggregate traffic (e.g. page views, referrers, device category) so I can see what’s useful and improve the content.

Cloudflare positions Web Analytics as **privacy-focused** and **cookie-free by default**.

- [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/)
- [Cloudflare Web Analytics docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/)

## What I’m trying to avoid

- No advertising pixels
- No selling of personal data
- No tracking across other websites by me

## What you can do

- If you block analytics scripts (e.g. via a browser setting, tracking protection, or an ad blocker), the site should still work.

## Questions

If you have questions or spot something suspicious, open an issue on the repo: [https://github.com/rpothin/rpothin.github.io](https://github.com/rpothin/rpothin.github.io)
