# About Me

Hi, I’m Raphael Pothin.

I work at the intersection of **platform governance**, **developer experience**, and increasingly **AI in software engineering**—especially what happens when **AI agents** become part of daily delivery.

This site is where I share what I’m learning as I build, test, and refine practical approaches that teams can actually use.

## What you’ll find here

I write for **Power Platform admins**, **software engineers**, and **technical engineering leaders**—especially if you care about scaling delivery without losing control.

You can expect:

- **Practical governance** for Power Platform / Dynamics 365 / Fabric (Power BI): guardrails that enable rather than block
- **ALM and software delivery** lessons (patterns, pitfalls, “this worked / this didn’t”)
- **AI engineering experiments**: how I use AI to augment real workflows (and what I’ve stopped doing)
- Occasional **reference implementations**, templates, and small open-source utilities

My goal is simple: **reduce the cost of learning** by sharing the details I wish I had earlier.

## Why listen to me?

A few quick trust signals (and then we get back to the interesting part):

- I’m a **Microsoft MVP (Business Applications)**
- I’ve worked from hands-on delivery in **Dynamics/Power Platform** to **ALM + governance** roles where reliability and scale matter
- I enjoy contributing through **talks, writing, and open-source**

## A bit of my story

I was born in **Réunion** (a French island in the Indian Ocean), studied and started my career in **Lyon (France)**, and later moved to **Montreal (Canada)**—where I’m building both a life and a long-term path in tech.

Over time, my work shifted from building features to asking bigger questions like:

> How do we scale a platform safely?  
> How do we make developers faster without breaking production?  
> And now: how does AI change the answer to both?
